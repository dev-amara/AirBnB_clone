# AIRBNB CLONE - CONSOLE
## Project Description
*The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Holberton School/ALX that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.*

### Fuctionalities

1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
4. Update attributes of an object
5. Destroy an object

**In a nutshell**
- create the data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
